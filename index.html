        <b>Why We Care: </b> 
        <br>
        <br>
        We can see from the data collected, which measures followers, total
        likes, average likes, posts, and an "influence score", that as your followers, posts, and likes increase, your
        influence increases as well.
      <p>All of these elements listed have a direct linear relationship with the influence
        score.
        As
        your followers, posts, and likes increase, your influence on others increases. This can matter a lot in terms of
        marketing; for example, it can make companies lots of money through advertising.

        <b> We are trying to answer these following questions with the given data: </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        -Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the number of 
        followers an influencer has and their influence score?
        <br>
        <br>
        -Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the average likes an 
         influencer has on a post and their influence score?
        <br>
        <br>
        -Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total number of 
        likes an influencer has and their influence score?
        <br>
        <br>
        -Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the number of posts            an influencer has made and their influence score?

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Approach to Answering: </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        I answered these questions by looking at specific columns of data within the dataset, cleaning them, and visualizing them. I converted the units K, M, and B to their respective conversions. I got rid of all columns except the influence score, number of followers, average likes, number of posts, and the total number of likes
