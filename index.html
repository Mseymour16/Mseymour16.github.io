      <p><b>Why We Care: </b> We can see from the data collected, which measures followers, total
        likes, average likes, posts, and an "influence score", that as your followers, posts, and likes increase, your
        influence increases as well.
      <p>All of these elements listed have a direct linear relationship with the influence
        score.
        As
        your followers, posts, and likes increase, your influence on others increases. This can matter a lot in terms of
        marketing; for example, it can make companies lots of money through advertising.

        -Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the number of 
        followers an influencer has and their influence score?
