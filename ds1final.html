        <b>Why We Care: </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Knowing similarities between the 50 most popular songs of the last decade can be very helpful while trying to make a hit song. Taking elements of these older songs and newer elements of today's music is the perfect way to make that #1 song!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b> We are trying to answer these following questions with the given data: </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        -Is there a statistically significant correlation between the track lengths of the 50 most popular songs from 2010-2019 and their popularity scores?
        <br>
        <br>
        -Is there a statistically significant correlation between the BPM of the 50 most popular songs from 2010-2019 and their popularity scores?
        <br>
        <br>
        -Is there a statistically significant correlation between the loudness (in decibles) of the 50 most popular songs from 2010-2019 and their popularity scores?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Approach to Answering: </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        When answering these questions, I first took a look at what the data was providing and what could be of use to me. I then dropped all the columns except for Song Title, 
        Artist, Year, BPM, Loudness, Track Length, and Popularity. I then looked at the stats for all of these variables to make sure nothing was out of the ordianry. After I
        found that everything was normal, I started visualizing. I compared Track Length, BPM, Loudness, and Year to Popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>My Findings: </b>
        <br>
        <br>
          Track Length: We can see from the graph, that as track length increased, the popularity decreased. This can show music artists to keep their big hits short and sweet!
          As our attention spans get shorter, we desire shorter songs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Beats Per Minute: We can see that as the BPM of popular songs increased, the popularity stayed more or less the same. This proves to artists that compared to the other variables
        of hit songs, that artists can keep their songs fast or slow and they'll still hit #1!
        <br>
        <br>
        Loudness: Although it looks hard to read, we can see through this graph that there is a slight increase of popularity relative to an increase in loudness. This can influence artists
        to make their songs much louder than they are now!
        <br>
        <br>
        Year: We can also see that as the years increased so did the popularity! As streaming became more widestream through apps like Spotify and Apple Music, 
        the popularity of songs got much bigger.

        <b>Interpretation of Findings and Threats to Validity: </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        From these findings we can see that there is a statistically significant correlation between Track Length and Popularity as well as Loudness and Popularity. 
        Although, there doesn't seem to be any significant change between BPM and Popularity; it relatively stays the same.
        <br>
        <br>
        Important threats to Validity can be that this only shows the top 50 hits from the last 10 years as opposed to 100 or 200. 50 is not enough to show the trends of different years.
        It also doesn't provide every genre; the trends of different genres can be very different than the ones provided. Rock for example, is usually a lot louder than pop and there
        is little rock music being displayed in the data. In conclusion, it doesn't show all of the music trends of the last 10 years.
